# Imagechain-For-Medical-Records-Using-Blockchain

Blockchain is a breakthrough technology used to create distributed databases. 
The data are stored in the form of a chain that grows incrementally, and the information, once saved, is immutable. 
Each block of data is connected to the previous one with a cryptographic hash function to ensure the integrity and prevent tampering with data (in fact, modifying even a single bit in the chain would require recomputing all hashes from the altered block to the last one, which is a power-consuming task). 
Our modern world has witnessed a revolution in digital information, which has had an impact upon our societies and lives. 
On the other hand, many challenges have arisen embedded in the easy access for this information and revealing them, especially if we know that part of them is very important and needs protection as well as secrecy for various reasons. 
For protecting most of such information and data, which require secrecy, the need for inventing protection systems has become necessary, amongst them our research that deals with the studying and constructing a proposed system for this task. 
Here we will use images that will use cryptography and blockchain for image security and privacy. 
Inspired by the effectiveness of emerging blockchain technology, a security framework, image chain is proposed to ensure the security and privacy of the sensitive images. 
The practical challenges associated with the proposed framework and further research that is required are also highlighted.
